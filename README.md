# Galapagotchi

## Under construction

There is an initial [website](https://galapagotchi.run)

## To Do

* interpolate between genes during one sweep, clutch is just from rest
* move muscle info into the intervals
* spray random, but then have smooth functions (opposite, same)
* gotch view
* separated behavior genes, mutate during usage only
* look at angular instead of react
* revive some kind of turbo mode, or non-viewing page
* allow for choosing launch direction
* launch any gotchi by clicking on the seed
* spot physics (land vs water)
* growth limited by genes instead of size
* server
