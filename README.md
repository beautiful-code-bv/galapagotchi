# Pretenst Design

Pretenst software is tool for designing four-dimensional physical structures made from elements of pure compression (bars) and tension (cables) and exploring how they behave over time and under stress.

## The Essence of Physical Structure

Pretenst structure, otherwise known as **tensegrity**, is minimalistic. It is structure distilled down to the basics of push and pull. It's because of this that these structures appear to be lighter than air, defying gravity, and that gives them their elegant beauty. The defining feature of tensegrity is that the pushing elements or bars are **floating**, separated from each other and only held together by a **network of tension**. The shape maintains its integrity because of the tension, and the compression pushing outwards is only localized.

## Dynamic Shape

Every structure is to some degree dynamic, since they all exist in time and can be deformed, however slightly. We can imagine this if we zoom in. Tapping on one side of a piece of diamond causes a shockwave of atomic scale forces which make their way across the crystal lattice of the diamond over to the other side where the tap can be felt, but the effect inevitably takes time to get from one side to the other. When we don't see this, we are simply not looking closely enough.

The pretenst structures that we explore here expose the dynamic nature of structure by making it explicit. A disturbance in one part of a pretenst structure shakes the next element, which shakes the next, until the entire shape is chaotically jittering. The wave of disturbance are there for us to observe, and it should trigger our imagination to picture how this is actually happening always and everywhere.

## Playing with Physics

The pretenst model lets us "play god" and toy with physics, since we're able to change all the physics features freely on the fly while modeling. The real world is far too restricted when you want to really explore this design space. In the real world we experience constant gravity, and our building materials have unchanging features like their elasticity and density. While designing, we need to be free!

Ultimately, of course, when we get to the stage of building the actual physical structures, we must dial back the reckless carefree physics and bring it back to the actual challenges that face us here on Earth (or on the Moon, or in outer space, depending on the goals). The pretenst software is built to take us gradually from the unreal into the real, the objective being always to find ways to build **physical things**.

## Visualizing the Pretension

Pushing elements (bars) are being compressed to be slightly shorter than they would be without the tension, and pulling elements (cables) are being stretched slightly longer than they would be without the bars. In a pretenst tensegrity, everything is strained a bit, because otherwise the structure wouldn't be stiff. This is the heart of the matter!

In the real world such strains are certainly measurable, sometimes visible, but builders need to understand them intimately so that they can do the numbers and make sure things are built to last and carry loads without collapsing.

The pretenst software is all about fostering a deeper understanding of this very thing, so the visualization is set up to allow users to greatly exaggerate the effects of strain. This is very useful in exposing to the designer where the strain is intense and where it is weak or absent altogether.

What the visualization does, almost paradoxically, is that it shows the pushing and pulling elements at the length that they would be if each of them indidually were not strained at all! Compressed bars appear a little bit longer, and stretched cables appear a little bit shorter, so in this visualizztion the two actually do not touch each other (unless the strain happens to be zero).

Depending on the physics parameters, the effect may be so small that you cannot even see it, so pretenst has a feature which multiplies the effect to bring it unambiguously into view.

## Not Stacking Bricks

When we think of building a house, we think of are made of stacking solid bricks on top of one another, maybe with something like cement trowelled in between to stick them together. Gravity holds the bricks down as we build the walls, and we lay down some thick beams horizontally when we need to support a floor. It all seems more or less like an exercise in stacking solid things. There are pushing and pulling forces throughout, but they're hidden to us.

A bridge or a really tall building with some kind of skeleton structure goes a bit further, so then we need to start thinking about where all the forces come from and where they go. This is what civil engineers do for a living. How much weight can this bridge hold? How thick do the beams need to be to hold up this building? Maybe even: How does this building behave during an earthquake?

## Concrete and Steel

Civil engineers don't just use concrete, because they know that concrete on its own will just crumble and fall apart. As we've all seen when we peek through the fence at a building site, the first thing they do is lay down a lattice of steel rods, and only later do they pour the concrete. It's only the combination of the concrete and the pre-tensed steel rods that actually makes it last. Pre-tension is everywhere! It's just mostly hidden.

## The Connector Problem

Building tensegrity structures is generally quite difficult, because the end of every bar has to be connected to four or more cables which converge there. It resembles the top of a circus tent where the pole holding the tent up carries the membrane of the tent, only instead of a membrane there are cables. The pole opposes the force of the cables. The hard part is making a durable connection which joins the cables to hold back the pole, and the reason it's hard is because it is inevitablly the weakest link.
