# Galapagotchi

Welcome to the galapagotchi project, where you can create and evolve your own personal creature.

This is a Galapagotch island. In the local dialect, "galapa" means "permanently interwoven" and a "gotch" is a hexagon-shaped pattern of spots.

Each galapagotchi emerges from its own home gotch, evolving shape and then muscle coordination. Every gotch is unique, interwoven with its neighbors, and represents a single place. Together they form a Galapagotch island.

The genes of a galapagotchi are not DNA like ours, but are instead frozen sequences of dice `⚀⚁⚂⚃⚄⚅`.

Surviving galapagotchi are the ones who froze the right dice, according to the rules discovered by [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) and elaborated by [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins). The rest of the dice are recycled.

A mutated gene is a near-perfect copy of the original frozen dice, but with some dice randomly thrown. The result of tossing a few dice is anybody's guess.

A gotchi evolves in an accelerated "multiverse" where they compete with mutated versions of themselves in the same space. While evolving, they look like ghosts. The slowest are forgotten as new mutated offspring are born.
