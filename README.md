# Pretenst Design

Pretenst software is tool for designing four-dimensional physical structures made from elements of pure compression (bars) and tension (cables) and exploring how they behave over time and under stress.

## The Essence of Physical Structure

Pretenst structure, otherwise known as **tensegrity**, is minimalistic. It is structure distilled down to the basics of push and pull. It's because of this that these structures appear to be lighter than air, defying gravity, and that gives them their elegant beauty. The defining feature of tensegrity is that the pushing elements or bars are **floating**, separated from each other and only held together by a **network of tension**. The shape maintains its integrity because of the tension, and the compression pushing outwards is only localized.
