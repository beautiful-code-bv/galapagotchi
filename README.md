### Born to run

The quickest way to understand a bit about this project is to see it in action:

</a>

### Try it 

The app is live online at [https://galapagotchi.run](https://galapagotchi.run/), so you can see what it's like to experience this little fictional universe. You can test drive existing *gotchi* belonging to other people, or if you have a Twitter handle, you can claim a lot of land where you can evolve your own *gotchi*. Currently work in progress.

### Multiverse evolution

See a group of nearly equal competitors fight for survival in the same place at the same time, each one with slightly mutated genes compared to the others. We call this the "multiverse", and evolving like this should give an intuitive sense of *Darwin's Natural Selection* works.
