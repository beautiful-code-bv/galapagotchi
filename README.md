Welcome to the [galapagotchi.run](https://galapagotchi.run) project, where you can create and evolve your own personal runner. It's like a game, and together we can make it more fun!

By the way [look here](https://github.com/beautiful-code-bv/galapagotchi) or [find me](https://twitter.com/fluxe) if you are a developer interested in [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL)/[ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) or Darwin's [Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_Dangerous_Idea).

The genes of a galapagotchi are not DNA like ours, but are instead frozen sequences of dice.

A mutated gene is a near-perfect copy, but with some dice randomly tossed. The result of tossing a few dice [is anybody's guess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker). 

A gotchi evolves in an accelerated kind of "multiverse" where they compete with mutated versions of themselves in the same space. While evolving, they look a bit like ghosts. 

To acquire running behavior, a *gotchi* continues its multiverse evolution with a drive to run and a sense of direction (*intelligent design*: guilty as charged, don't want to wait [billions of years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth)). 

A *gotchi* competes against mutations of itself, like toy bacteria might, but it can evolve to run with conviction!

As the [Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins)-inspired evolution proceeds, the slowest are forgotten while the fastest become pregnant and give birth to mutations of themselves, tossing a few dice.

Surviving galapagotchi are the ones who froze the right dice, according to the natural rules discovered by [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) and elaborated by Dawkins and others since. Their genes come from a long line of frozen dice patterns that were almost exactly as successful at making their bodies run.
