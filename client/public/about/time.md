# Time

* finish this

Time is a tricky one, because we really have trouble describing what time is for ourselves. Before we invent time, let's think about what we will expect it to do. We will want things to move over time, so for us, time is movement. But wait, where is all of this going to take place? We need space. One step at a time.

So now we must invent *time*, and we'll keep it as simple as we can. Imagine *intervals* being active in the daytime, and *joints* being active at night.

At daybreak, our fictional *time* passes through all the *intervals*, giving each one a chance to express itself. An *interval* pushes or pulls, to get closer to its preferred length. To make this work, we have to record what they have said, and they *talk* in forces. We hold on to these forces as rays outward from each of the *joints*, so a joint becomes a collection of rays as well as a placeholder spot in space. Think of *joints* as stars that come out at night.

As twilight approaches, the *intervals* go silent and the *joints* wake up. During the night it is time for the joints to decide where to move. Each *joint* finds a new location for itself before morning by adding up all of its rays, so opposite ones cancel each other out. What remains is a single ray, so the joint jumps to the end of the ray before morning comes.

At sunrise, the *joints* are all asleep in their new locations and the *intervals* once again wake up to find their two end joints to be at an unsatisfying distance from each other. They push or pull to correct the problem before nightfall, and then the joints come out again, and so on.

This is the passage of our fictional time, and things move as our movie flashes from one frame to the next. Every *day* we take a picture right before the sun comes up, and these snapshots become our movie.

The day/night analogy is useful to understand the back and forth of the *intervals* and *joints*, but at some point you will have to radically spees up the clock. In the Galalpagotchi code, these cycles happen thousands of times per second! First things first, we'll get to that.
