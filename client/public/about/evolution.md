# Evolution

The evolution algorithm in *Galapagotchi* is a quite simple refinement process, more like how **bacteria** evolve than how other organisms do it, because there is no sexual recombination, only mutation.

The evolution is a *visual* process, because the most interesting effect of this project is intended to be the insights that users gain about **evolution** while playing with it.

We call it **multiverse** because the ghostly bodies can effortlessly occupy the same space at the same time, so it vaguely echoes the idea that many universes exist in parallel.

A small population of competitors (20-30) is created, and each one starts out with [genes](gene.md) which are slightly mutated compared to the others. The mutations are random, and all they do is effectively toss a few dice. 

The effects on the body's shape and behavior are completely unpredictable. A pair of muscles will push or pull at a slightly different time than a competitor, so the body either manages to run a little faster or not. Every precious improvement is **kept** because the body that has it will stay alive and produce offspring.

The *evolution* process only forgets the slowest runners, so you don't have to be the best, you just have to avoid being among the worst. (*Demise of the Least Fit* is a better slogan than *Survival of the Fittest*).
